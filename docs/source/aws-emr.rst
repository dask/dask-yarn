Deploying on Amazon EMR
=======================

`Amazon Elastic MapReduce`_ (EMR) is a web service for creating a cloud-hosted
Hadoop cluster.

Dask-Yarn works out-of-the-box on Amazon EMR, following the :doc:`quickstart`
as written should get you up and running fine. We recommend doing the
installation step as part of a `bootstrap action`_.

For a curated installation, we also provide an `example bootstrap action`_ for
installing Dask and Jupyter on cluster startup. This script is heavily
commented, and can be used as an example if you need a more customized
installation.

Here we provide a brief walkthrough of a workflow we've found useful when
deploying Dask on Amazon EMR:


Configure the EMR Cluster
-------------------------

The EMR documentation contains an example showing how to `configure and start
an EMR cluster`_. We recommend referencing their documentation. A few notes on
recommended settings:

- If you plan to use a `bootstrap action`_, you'll need to follow the ``Go to
  advanced options`` link on the ``Create Cluster`` page - this feature is not
  available under ``Quick Options``.

- When chosing which applications to install, ``dask-yarn`` only requires a
  Hadoop installation, all other applications are optional depending on your
  workflow.

While this configuration can take some time and thought, the next time you want
to start a Dask cluster on EMR you can `clone this cluster`_ to reuse the
configuration.

Add a Bootstrap Action
----------------------

To make installation on a clean cluster easier, we recommend scripting the
installation as part of a `bootstrap action`_.  For a curated install, we
provide an `example bootstrap action`_ that you may use. This script does the
following:

- Installs miniconda_.

- Installs ``dask``, ``distributed``, ``dask-yarn``, pyarrow_, and s3fs_. This
  list of packages can be extended using the ``--conda-packages`` flag.

- Packages the environment with `conda-pack`_ for distribution to the workers.

- Optionally installs and starts a `Jupyter Notebook`_ server running on port
  8888. This can be disabled with the ``--no-jupyter`` flag. The password for
  the notebook server can be set with the ``--password`` option, the default
  is ``dask-user``.

If you require a more customized install than this, you may wish to provide
your own script. The `example script`_ is heavily commented, and should
hopefully provide enough of a reference for your use.

To use the script, follow AWS's documentation on `using bootstrap actions`_.
You'll need to upload the script to an S3 bucket accessible to your project
first.


Start the EMR Cluster
---------------------

Once you've finished configuring your cluster, you can start it with the
``Create Cluster`` button. This may take a while (~10 mins), depending on your
settings.


Connect to the EMR Cluster
--------------------------

Once the cluster is running, you'll want to connect to it. Depending on your
``EC2 security groups`` settings, you may have direct access to the cluster, or
you may need to start an ssh tunnel (default). For either of these you'll need
to know the public DNS name of your master node. This address looks like
``ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com``, and can be found by following
`the AWS documentation
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-master-node-ssh.html>`__.

**Direct Access**

If you have direct access to the cluster, you should be able to access the
resource-manager WebUI at ``<public-dns-name>:8088``.  If you used our provided
bootstrap action, the Jupyter Notebook should be available at
``<public-dns-name>:8888``.

**Using an SSH Tunnel**

If you don't have direct access, you'll need to start an SSH tunnel to access
the Web UIs or the Jupyter Notebook. For more information, see the `AWS
documentation
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-ssh-tunnel-local.html>`__.

If you used our provided bootstrap action, the Jupyter Notebook should be
available at ``<public-dns-name>:8888``, and can be accessed by starting a SSH
tunnel via:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ssh -i ~/mykeypair.pem -L 8888:<public-dns-name>:8888 hadoop@<public-dns-name>

where ``~/mykeypair.pem`` is your ``.pem`` file, and ``<public-dns-name>`` is
the public DNS name of your master node.


Create a Dask Cluster
---------------------

.. currentmodule:: dask_yarn

At this point you should have access to a running EMR cluster, with Dask and
its dependencies installed. To create a new Dask cluster running inside the EMR
cluster, create an instance of :class:`YarnCluster`. If you didn't use our
bootstrap action, you'll also need to provide a path to your packaged
environment (see :doc:`environments` for more information).

.. code-block:: python

    from dask_yarn import YarnCluster
    from dask.distributed import Client

    # Create a cluster in local deploy mode, to have access to the dashboard
    cluster = YarnCluster(deploy_mode='local')

    # Connect to the cluster
    client = Client(cluster)

By default no workers are started on cluster creation. To change the number of
workers, use the :func:`YarnCluster.scale` method. When scaling up, new workers
will be requested from YARN. When scaling down, workers will be intelligently
selected and scaled down gracefully, freeing up resources.

.. code-block:: python

    # Scale up to 10 workers
    cluster.scale(10)

    # ...

    # Scale back down to 2 workers
    cluster.scale(2)

If you're working interactively in a `Jupyter Notebook`_ you can also use the
provided graphical interface to change the cluster size.

If you used our bootstrap action, and start your cluster with
``deploy_mode='local'``, the `dask dashboard`_ will also be available, and the
link included in the cluster widget above.


Shutdown the EMR Cluster
------------------------

You can start, scale, and stop many *Dask* clusters within a single EMR
cluster. When you're finally done doing your work, you'll want to shutdown the
whole EMR cluster to conserve resources. See the `AWS documentation
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs-reset-environment.html>`__
for more information.
