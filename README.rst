Dask-Yarn deploys Dask on `YARN
<https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html>`_
clusters, such as are found in traditional Hadoop installations. Dask-Yarn
provides an easy interface to quickly start, stop, and scale Dask clusters
natively from Python.

See `the documentation <http://yarn.dask.org>`_ for more information.
